##Decentralized run-to-earn platform (Mobile app). E.run

Objective:
To develop a decentralized platform that incentivizes users to engage in physical activities,
such as running, by earning cryptocurrency or rewards. The platform integrates GPS
tracking and accelerometer data from mobile devices to monitor user activity and reward
them for staying active.

Motivation:
- Encourage physical fitness by providing a financial incentive for users to stay active.
- Utilize blockchain technology for transparency and fairness in reward distribution.
- Foster a community around health and fitness with gamified experiences.

## Core Features:

- **Activity Tracking via GPS and Accelerometer:** Tracks user movement and
distance in real-time using GPS and phone sensors to reward activity.
- **Smart Contracts for Reward Distribution:** Automatically distributes rewards
(tokens/crypto) to users based on their physical activity without intermediaries
- **Health Analytics: ** Provides users with insights like calories burned,
distance covered, and fitness improvements over time.
